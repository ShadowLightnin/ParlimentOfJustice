Erevos’s story:


Powers and Abilities

• Immortality: Erevos cannot die from aging, illness, or most injuries. His cells regenerate rapidly, allowing him to heal from wounds that would be fatal to others.
• Cosmic Energy Manipulation: Residual power from his encounter with the celestial event grants him abilities akin to dark matter manipulation, including energy projection, force fields, and limited telekinesis.
• Enhanced Intelligence and Strategic Mastery: With thousands of years of experience, Erevos has accumulated knowledge of warfare, politics, science, and psychology, making him a nearly unbeatable tactician.
• Physical Augmentation: His strength, agility, and stamina far surpass normal human limits. Over time, his body has developed beyond its initial enhancements, allowing him to survive extreme environments, including the vacuum of space for brief periods.

Personality

Erevos is patient, knowing that time is always on his side. He is deeply arrogant yet possesses a charm that has seduced countless leaders and warriors throughout history to join his cause. His contempt for the Parliament of Justice is profound, as he views their resistance as an immature defiance against humanity’s destined ruler. Erevos despises what he sees as their misplaced ideals of “freedom” and “justice,” believing that the only way to create a true utopia is under his rule.

Current Agenda

Erevos has been covertly working on a plan known as The Convergence—an operation intended to siphon the powers of every hero on Earth, the Parliament included. Using an ancient artifact, the Celestial Eye, he seeks to harness these energies to amplify his own abilities, aiming to achieve a level of power that would allow him to reshape reality itself. Once accomplished, Erevos envisions a new era: a world of his design where he reigns supreme and unquestioned, an eternal god of an immortal empire.

In facing Erevos, the Parliament of Justice encounters not only a formidable enemy but a living embodiment of humanity’s potential for both greatness and corruption.


Yes, Erevos the Eternal does indeed have his own dark cabal, mirroring The Light from Young Justice, with a powerful alliance of villains who share his twisted ideals or stand to benefit from his ultimate vision. Additionally, his influence runs so deep that he’s made a pact with a cosmic-level villain akin to Darkseid—a dark overlord of the universe who values domination above all else. As if that weren’t enough, Erevos’s immortal bloodline holds a dark secret: he is the direct progenitor of all meta-powers on Earth, which adds layers to his grip on power and his claim over humanity’s future.

Erevos’s Cabal: The Light

The Light is Erevos’s secret council of powerful, morally ambiguous individuals and villains who all operate under his influence and serve his grand vision of world domination. Each member of The Light serves a specialized role, leveraging unique abilities or resources to carry out Erevos’s schemes across various sectors of society. Members are selected for their skills, loyalty to Erevos, and alignment with his worldview.

Members of The Light:

1. Noctura, the Illusionist: A master manipulator capable of bending reality and perception, Noctura has the power to influence entire populations through hallucinogenic energy. She manages psychological warfare and media manipulation, keeping the masses in a fog of confusion.
2. Sable, the Assassin: Sable is a merciless warrior with an arsenal of deadly, shadow-infused weaponry. Her ability to slip through dimensions allows her to be anywhere and nowhere, striking down threats to Erevos’s plans without leaving a trace.
3. Chrona, the Time-Bender: With control over small pockets of time, Chrona can slow, rewind, or even freeze time within a limited area. She uses her abilities to foresee potential obstacles to Erevos’s rule, manipulating events in his favor.
4. Obelisk, the Warlock: A master of ancient dark arts and mysticism, Obelisk performs rituals that enhance Erevos’s strength and manipulate supernatural forces to bend to The Eclipse’s will. He also maintains a portal to the cosmic realm.
5. Titanus, the Titan of Steel: Enhanced by experimental cybernetics and mutated DNA, Titanus is the muscle of The Eclipse, with strength that rivals even the strongest Titans of the Parliament. His primary role is to crush resistance with brute force.
6. Red Mercury: An industrialist who serves as the public face and financial powerhouse behind many of Erevos’s schemes. Red Mercury provides The Eclipse with money, resources, and political connections, shielding their plans from public scrutiny.

Cosmic Pact with the Dark Overlord: The Devourer

Erevos’s ambitions don’t stop at world domination; his visions extend to the cosmos itself. Through his occult studies and interdimensional journeys, Erevos crossed paths with The Devourer, a being of unimaginable darkness, known for his eternal hunger to consume worlds and impose order through conquest. The Devourer is a warlord who rules entire galaxies, maintaining power by siphoning life forces from planets he destroys.

Their pact is as mutually beneficial as it is dangerous:

• Erevos Provides: Strategic influence on Earth, turning the planet into a source of powerful meta-humans and resources that will eventually be harvested by The Devourer in exchange for his cosmic support.
• The Devourer Provides: Dark energy enhancements that amplify Erevos’s powers, with promises of assistance if Erevos ever faces rebellion from Earth’s heroes. The Devourer’s cosmic minions occasionally visit Earth to enforce Erevos’s will or seek out meta-human champions as part of a grand tournament, testing their might before the final subjugation.

Ancestor of All Meta-Powers

Erevos’s ancient bloodline is laced with the celestial energies that first granted him immortality. Over time, he realized his descendants held fragments of this cosmic power, creating a lineage that became the foundation for all meta-human abilities. Throughout history, those who developed extraordinary powers could trace their ancestry back to Erevos, even if they were unaware.

This ancestral link gives Erevos a unique influence over meta-humans, particularly when he activates an artifact known as The Ancestral Sigil, which allows him to control or dampen meta-human powers to a degree. By claiming his rightful place as the first of their kind, Erevos leverages his ancestral connection to sway meta-humans, manipulating many into believing that following him is fulfilling their destiny.

The Grand Plan: Ascendancy

Erevos’s ultimate scheme, known as Ascendancy, is designed to bring every corner of the world—and potentially beyond—under his control. With The Eclipse orchestrating events on Earth, and his alliance with The Devourer securing his place in the cosmos, Ascendancy involves:

1. Subjugation of Meta-Humans: Using The Ancestral Sigil, Erevos plans to bend all meta-humans to his will, turning them into his personal army.
2. Reshaping Earth’s Reality: With the combined resources of The Eclipse and the dark energy from The Devourer, Erevos seeks to reshape Earth into a paradise of his own vision—under his eternal rule.
3. The Final Harvest: Erevos has promised Earth to The Devourer for his cosmic hunger, envisioning a universe where Earth’s meta-human champions will fuel The Devourer’s ascension, creating an unstoppable cosmic empire with Erevos as its Eternal ruler.

Erevos the Eternal stands as a dark nexus of ancient power, cosmic ambition, and sheer ruthless will. His mastery over both Earthly and interdimensional forces, combined with his ancestral claim over meta-humanity, makes him the ultimate villain that the Parliament, Titans, and all champions of justice must unite to face, if they hope to keep Earth free from his shadow and cosmic enslavement.


Yes, Erevos’s deal with The Devourer is indeed a winner-takes-all arrangement, heightening the stakes of their partnership and the overall conflict. Here’s how the deal works:

The Winner-Takes-All Deal

1. Mutual Goals: Both Erevos and The Devourer have aligned interests: total domination. Erevos seeks to rule Earth and shape it into his vision, while The Devourer desires to consume it and absorb its resources, including its meta-humans. Their partnership is thus built on the premise that they will work together to achieve these goals, but only one of them can ultimately claim victory.
2. Control of Earth: If Erevos succeeds in his plans for Ascendancy and subjugates the meta-humans to his will, he will retain control over Earth, ensuring it becomes a haven for meta-beings under his dominion. Conversely, if The Devourer triumphs, he will take Earth as a cosmic feast, consuming its life force and dismantling Erevos’s ambitions.
3. The Devourer’s Cosmic Harvest: The Devourer has the power to siphon life forces from planets, including those of meta-humans. Erevos’s role is to gather and present Earth’s strongest meta-humans to The Devourer as part of the final harvest. If he fails to deliver, or if he is outmaneuvered by The Devourer, he risks losing everything he has worked to build, including his own existence.
4. Eternal Consequences: The pact has a temporal aspect; Erevos and The Devourer have set a timeline for their grand plan. If Erevos fails to secure his position or thwart the heroes of the Parliament and Titans within that timeframe, The Devourer will have the right to take Earth by force, with Erevos being treated as an expendable ally.
5. Strategic Rivalry: Their relationship is inherently volatile. As they work together, both Erevos and The Devourer are constantly watching each other’s moves, ready to exploit weaknesses. If Erevos begins to amass too much power, The Devourer might view him as a potential threat, leading to further intrigue and betrayal.

Conclusion

This winner-takes-all deal intensifies the narrative and conflict in the story. It raises the stakes for Erevos and creates an atmosphere of mistrust, ambition, and inevitable betrayal, setting the stage for dramatic confrontations with the heroes of the Parliament, the Titans, and anyone else who stands in their way. The looming threat of The Devourer’s appetite for domination adds a layer of urgency to the heroes’ mission to thwart Erevos and his dark ambitions.

The Meeting of Erevos and The Devourer

Setting the Scene

• Time Period: The meeting occurred during a time of great turmoil on Earth, a period marked by escalating conflicts among nations, the rise of meta-humans, and the emergence of powerful supernatural forces. This chaos created the perfect breeding ground for Erevos’s ambition and The Devourer’s hunger for domination.
• Location: The encounter took place in a hidden temple deep within an ancient mountain range, a site steeped in dark magic and forgotten knowledge. This temple was built by a long-lost civilization that had once worshipped The Devourer as a god, leaving behind inscriptions and artifacts that spoke of his insatiable hunger.

The Encounter

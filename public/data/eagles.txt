They are:

• Official arm of the Parliament of Justice

They’re not superheroes — they’re trained operatives, human-level, highly disciplined.

• Their purpose

High-risk arrests

Hostage rescue

Anti-terror operations

Outer Darkness containment

Vigilante interdiction (after The Incident)

Supporting Parliament infantry when things escalate

• Uniform & Equipment Style (Canon Accurate)

Modern tactical armor (MTEK/FAST helmets, ballistic plates)

Color: charcoal / gunmetal + gold accents (Zion’s color)

Tactical visors & body cams

Compact railguns (your universe’s equivalent to high-caliber rifles)

Armored vans, black SUVs, and rapid-deployment choppers

One or two experimental gadgets (non-superhero level):

grappling drones
